# Cache
Implemented direct-mapped L1 cache and set-associative L2 cache system to analyze cache miss rate and miss penalty in modern computer architecture systems.

To run this code, follow these steps:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Clone the repository  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/jainmehul0518/Cache.git  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Run the memory_driver executable on specified test script  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./memory_driver "test script name"  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The memory_driver executable will return back the L1 miss rate, L2 miss rate, and average access time for both caches.
