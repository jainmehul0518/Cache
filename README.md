# Cache
Implemented direct-mapped L1 cache and set-associative L2 cache system to analyze cache miss rate and miss penalty in modern computer architecture systems.

To run this code, follow these steps:  
  (1) Clone the repository  
      git clone https://github.com/jainmehul0518/Cache.git  
  (2) Run the memory_driver executable on specified test script  
      ./memory_driver <test script name>  
  (3) The memory_driver executable will return back the L1 miss rate, L2 miss rate, and average access time for both caches.
